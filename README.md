# **Stock market prediction using PySpark ðŸ“ˆ**
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

Using machine learning techniques through PySpark I will try to: 

* predict the stock value of more than 700 companies over a period of 20 years
* predict the stock value of more than 1200 companies over a period of 5 years, this time using financial indicators

After having trained this tools, I will test them during the COVID crisis period, a major financial crisis in which even the best stock lost value, and see how they perform in comparison to a normal period. 
Finally I will try LSMT, a more advanced tool for this task, and see how it compares with more linear methods.  

In order to correctly execute the notebook, follow each step sequentially, because each step depend on the previous one.
